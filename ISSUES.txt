# List of things to improve or to change

## ssh key handling
Setting up new VMs create new ssh-host-keys which need to be updated in local known_hosts file. Currently i delete old key manualy and type yes 2x number of systems.

. options to look at:
ssh-keyscan server-name >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
OR: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no 
both might not work with "virtctl ssh ..."

### ssh key handling multi cluster
The Vms are identified with vmname and namespace, but in mutli-cluster setup we have duplicate host identifiers with differen host-keys.

### Move from Bash to Ansible
As this scales out to ca 40 hosts and has multiple steps, it would be nice if i could just redo the failed / still missing systems, instead of redoing them all. 

### subscription-manager
I automated the registration but the deregistration does not happen, leaving load of orphaned entries in the account

### VM connectivity challange VM start
We should start all VMs in prep to the challenge so the storage gets provisions


### Set up Multus for image mode VM so that connectivity to the VM does not need local virtctl nor oc.
